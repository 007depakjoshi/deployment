As a developer we have already created a node enviromnet on our machine and added n numbers of react app on it

Prerequisite : 
node js installed on your machine
react default running app in a folder on localhost (i.e http://localhost:3000/)


STEP 1
go to xampp->xampp-control panel click config for Apache
open Apache(httpd.config)
uncomment these line 
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
save the file

restart Apache xampp


STEP 2
need to set vhost and host in your system
edit httpd-vhosts.conf inside apache\conf\extra

added to your file after directory tag closed

	ProxyRequests on
	ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/
  
	file should look like somewhat this 

<VirtualHost *>
	DocumentRoot "D:\xampp\htdocs\foldername"
	ServerName ca.doaminname.net
	<Directory "D:\xampp\htdocs\foldername">
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all
	</Directory>
	ProxyRequests on
	ProxyPass /blog2/ http://localhost:3000/
</VirtualHost>


STEP 3 

edit your project package.json add "homepage" under name or on the top of name

  "homepage":"http://ca.doaminname.net/",
  
  
STEP 4

Run your react project with 
$ npm run build  
will help you to create a project build inside your folder
copy the files of build direcoty to your root directory (i.e main folder)

npm install -g serve
serve -s build

FOR MORE DETAIL REGARDING DEPLOYMENT

localhost will run on a domain http://ca.doaminname.net/
rather than an port
